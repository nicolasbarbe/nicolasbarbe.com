I gave a presentation last month at the [BaselOne](http://baselone.ch/), a conference happening every year in Basel. I spoke about Reactive Systems and illustrated the advantages of this approach with some concrete examples based on the latest Spring 5 which had been recently released.

The slides and the code shown during the livecoding session can be downloaded here:
